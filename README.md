# MixLit - Work in Progress
![Logo](https://github.com/SamMantell/MixLit/blob/main/assets/logos/mixlit-logo-2-LARGE.png)

The MixLit is a small sound desk that can control app volumes on a Windows PC. It uses an arduino nano as the controller and talks to our software over USB serial.

The case can be 3D printed and both STEP and STL files are provided

The PCB was designed in KiCAD and we used PCB Way to get them manafactured

Software is a Flutter application.

This repo contains firmware, software and hardware.
